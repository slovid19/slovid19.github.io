        <h3>About this Site</h3>
        <p class="about">
        With Cal Poly set to reopen "de-densified" in the Fall, it is important to have easily understandable data on the ongoing pandemic within SLO county.         </p>
        <h4>Why a Logarithmic Graph</h4>
        <p class="about">
        <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/world/corona-simulator/">Without intervention, viruses spread exponentially.</a> Exponential growth of a disease can quickly overwhelm healthcare institutions. The logarithmic graphs shown above can better illustrate whether the growth rate of COVID-19 is exponential or not. 
        </p> 
        <h4>Understanding a Logarithmic Scale</h4>
        <p class="about">
        A straight steep line on a logarithmic scale reveals fast exponential growth, but a downward curve or a flat line reveals a slower growth rate. The graph of COVID-19 cases often switches between the two. For instance, the cases in San Luis Obispo were exponentially growing in mid-June and thus the logarithmic graph of those cases has a roughly straight line during that time. That concept is highlighted in the graph below:

        <h4>Interpreting Results</h4>
        <p class="about">
        Since social distancing affects the growth rate of the coronavirus, a logarithmic graph can sometimes indicate how well or how poorly a population has been social distancing. This allows for a better understanding on the impact certain events and policies have on the growth of COVID-19.
